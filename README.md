# Trust-Management-in-Edge-Computing-
The main objective of the report is to analyze the different implementation techniques of trust management in the field of edge computing. In order to save time, memory and other computing resources the demand of edge computing is now increased due to which many security risks have been raised. One of the risks is trust management. Trust management basically establishes a trust mechanism between different edge devices in order to check the nature of data. The report consists of some approaches towards implementation of trust mechanisms like multi-layered fusion mechanism, block chain and trust management for IoT devices. These approaches have done the same work in different scenarios using different algorithms. In addition every method has different accuracy percentages in different factors like some are better in only reducing security risks but some also provide increment in speed with low memory usage along with high security protection. But comparative analysis of these proposed solutions show that the method of block chain is better because it reduces bad nodes more accurately, makes the system more secure, reliable and fast at low cost.
